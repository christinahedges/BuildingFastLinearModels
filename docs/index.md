# Building Fast Linear Models for Astronomical Noise and Signal

**What is this?**

There's lots of information online and in text books about linear algebra. This is a collection of that information with context that's quite specific to astronomy, meaning that we're going to be building towards explorations of real data, how to build models for actual problems, and discussing how some published noise models in astronomy work. Fitting linear models is how I do any low-grade 'magic' in astronomy, so I want to put some thoughts down to enable other people to do the same.

## About Me

I'm a scientist at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, USA. I am the Deputy Director of the [TESS GI Office](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/tess/), and the lead pipeline scientist for the upcoming [Pandora mission](https://pandoramission.github.io/pandorawebsite/). Before this, I used to work for the Kepler/K2 mission as a support scientist. I'm also a reseacher, and I spend my time discovering and characterizing exoplanets, and understanding data from NASA's space telescopes. You can read some more about me on [github](https://github.com/christinahedges).

I am very interested in astronomical data processing, and how to build simple models to help us understand the universe, which is why I wrote these materials. Everything here is a distilation of my workflow to use astronomical data. 

I have some other work, you can see some of my scientific publications [here](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=%20%20author%3A%22%5EHedges%2C%20Christina%22&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0), and I have some Opinions about how to write open source tools in astronomy, which you can read about in my [Astronomy Workflow tutorial](https://christinahedges.github.io/astronomy_workflow/) page.

## Contact

If you're interested to get in touch to understand more about TESS data, I recommend you reach out to the TESS GI helpdesk at [tesshelp@bigbang.gsfc.nasa.gov](tesshelp@bigbang.gsfc.nasa.gov). If you want to contact me directly, you can email me at christina.l.hedges@nasa.gov.
